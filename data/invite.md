## **Exun Clan**

Founded in 1991, Exun Clan is the Computer Science and technology club of Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, and the premier student-run STEM club in the country. Our motto, "We, not I", emphasizes our dedication to the principles of teamwork, sharing knowledge, and the spirit of collaboration.

For the past couple of decades, we have set the bar for technology competitions in India with new and exciting additions each year and then surpassed it ourselves, striving to continuously improve the symposium, club and ourselves. Examples include Exun Talks, our Girls in Tech initiative, and novel event concepts.


## **Introduction to the Exun 2024 Symposium**

Exun 2024 is our 29th annual international technology symposium hosted by high school students, which will be held during Exun Week during November 2nd-10th 2024. Preliminary/Online rounds for some events will be held between 2nd November and 6th November. Every year, STEM enthusiasts from India and beyond arrive at our symposium, both battling it out and coming together to have some of the most memorable and impactful experiences of their lives, deeply engaging with and celebrating the essence of technology on the way.

So, who should participate in Exun 2024? If you are someone, or know someone, who enjoys problem solving, loves expressing themselves digitally, has an interest in science and technology or simply wants to learn and explore, we can guarantee you’ll find plenty of quality opportunities, all in one place. Are you excited yet? We hope you are and we will gladly be looking forward to having you at our symposium! But wait, there is more you should know!

## **Sudocrypt v14.0**

Exun Clan’s flagship event of the year, we present Sudocrypt 14.0 this year, our annual international cryptic hunt. With thousands of participants and an exciting new system of game mechanics each year, levels are rewarding and sometimes challenging. Keep a lookout for the announcement and format for this year’s hunt (to be out soon)!

However, first, what is a "cryptic hunt"? To put it simply: Cryptic hunts are the online equivalent of treasure hunts and require you to hunt the internet for clues to solve questions.
